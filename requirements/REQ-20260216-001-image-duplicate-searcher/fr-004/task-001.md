# Task 001: Add ComputePerceptualHash method to ImageProcessor class

Add a public method `ComputePerceptualHash(MemoryStream thumbnail)` to the `ImageProcessor` class in `src/Services/ImageProcessor.cs`. The method should return an `ulong` representing the perceptual hash value.

## Deliverable
- Method signature added with XML documentation.
- Method body throws `NotImplementedException` for now.
